          <h1><b>A Lions Point of Veiw</b></h1>
    <p>Here we will dive deeper through visual representation of the daily struggles of the lion and a look at just how important Kevin is to their population growth and sustainability.</p>

    <h2><b>General Lion Information</b></h2>
    <p>
        Lions are the national animal of Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, England, Ethiopia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Singapore.  They are the second largest living feline species behind the tiger and throughout history they appear as a symbol of power, courage and nobility on family crests, coats of arms and national flags in many civilizations.  They have long been killed in rituals of bravery, as hunting trophies and for their “assumed” medicinal and magical powers.  In just about every major city in the world you will find statues of lions.  Lions sit majestically, with a foot up on a ball, or snarling like menacing beasts.  Humans have feared and admired their nobility and strength for thousands of years.</p>
    <br />
    <h2><b>A Rifles Roar</b></h2>
    <p>
        Approximately 1,500 lions are killed each year in South Africa alone as part of trophy hunts that not only deplete the population of the African lion but threatens its gene pool as well.  Killing the dominant male of a pride, normally the target of a trophy hunt, sets off a chain reaction of instinctive behaviors in which the subsequent dominant male kills all the offspring of the previous dominant male lion.  It is estimated that 6-8 feline deaths result from each dominant male that is shot.  Given the urgent need for revenue among Asians, Europeans, and Westerners, predators are increasingly hunted for sport, even as their numbers are in significant decline in their ranges. </p>

    <h4>Conservation Actions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Mitigation of Human Animal</b> Contact</li>
        <p>Retaliation is the primary reason for lion killings. We work with communities to help them realize the big cat’s value and to help them protect their families and livestock from carnivore predation. In Ruaha National Park, where 10 percent of the world’s remaining population can be found, AWF’s Ruaha Carnivore Project is fostering a much-needed shift in the local opinion of carnivores.</p>
        <li><b>Tracking Cats for Conservation</b></li>
        <p>With the continental population decreasing and threats continuing to mount, it’s become more important than ever to closely track this species. In Tanzania’s Manyara Ranch, AWF tagged the lions with high-tech collars equipped with radio transmitters to track the animals’ natural movements. This allows scientists and conservationists to monitor for potential disease outbreaks, home range, productivity, behavior, habitat use, survival, predator-prey interactions, and ultimately population estimates.</p>
        <li><b>Using Scientific Data</b></li>
        <p>African Wildlife Foundation’s researchers are working to gain an understanding of carnivores’ populations, behaviors, movements, and interactions with people in order to develop appropriate conservation actions. Since 2002, our Large Carnivore Research Project has undertaken research aimed at ensuring the continued survival of large predators living around Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.</p>
